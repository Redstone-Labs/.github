# Hello there, developer! ðŸ‘‹
We are glad to see you here. The team at Redstone Labs is thrilled to have you interested in helping with our projects. Your efforts will be certainly valued and appreciated. If you are new to contributing, we hope that this guide will give you a clear insight of our expectations and rulesets regarding how contributions work on Github.

### Codestack
New contributors are expected to be familiar with at least one of the programming languages we use at our projects.
|Project(s)| Language(s) |Information|
|--|--|--
| Minecraft Plugins | **Kotlin** |Our Minecraft plugins are coded in Kotlin. Kotlin allows us to achieve more concise, clear and organised code, thus limiting boilerplate to a minimum, to keep things more clear for everyone. 
|Discord bot|**Python**, **SQLite3**|Our Discord bot is coded in Python. Python also allows for clear syntax which is easy to maintain and organise.

## Our expectations
With different developers contributing to this project, it's important to establish a consistent and cohesive way to write and publish code. Therefore, you should consider establishing the following practices when collaborating in our projects:

- **(Not required)** It is highly recommended to use [this semantic ruleset](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/develop-semantic-title/) when creating Pull Requests. This allows everyone to get a quick glimpse on what changes you make, without wasting too much time looking at the code itself to see what it does.

	- **(Required)** You should link the issue you are fixing in the PR body. For example:
	 Body (1st line): ``Fixes {issue #} ...``
	 This allows Github to automatically close issues when a PR is merged.
		> We have implemented our own Pull Request template to make it easier for you to submit your first PR.
		
- Write consice and well documented code. Don't be afraid to add comments anywhere to help others understand what it does. You are also expected to use effective, non-deprecated coding methods so as to avoid any security vulnerabilities. If there is a more simple way to do something, you should try doing it that way.
- Try not to impact performance in your code. We do our best to have minimal performance drag in our plugins, and you should follow this movement too.

### Rules & Guidelines

- Do not be condescending to others. Everyone starts out somewhere! Try to be as helpful as possible, offering meaningful advice to fellow contributors.
- Do not engage in off-topic conversation in the comments. This makes it harder for others to follow the development process of your Pull Request and gives everyone else a hard time. In such occasions, organisation members reserve the right to moderate your messages.
	
	- This also includes posting memes, spamming, advertising and generally creating unnecessary clutter in the comments.
- Accept criticism and work on improving your code. Do not argue or fight back to any kind of negative feedback.


**Note:** The above rules apply to all contributors, moderators and organisation members. 

## Submitting a Pull Request
If you are new to submitting pull requests, this quick guide will help you discover what steps you have to take before your code is approved and published.
1. Fork your own copy of the repository you want to commit in. *(It is your responsibility to keep your fork up to date with the main repo)*
2. Create a new branch in the fork you created. The branch name should consicely represent the changes you are making.
3. Make the required code changes to solve the issue.
4. Create a pull request. The pull request should compare the branch you created (in your local fork) with the branch you want to merge into.
> **Note:** Please create a Pull Request only when you are done implementing the changes that have to made. The use of draft PRs is discouraged.
5. Post your pull request. You may make any final adjustments to your code as you wish.
6. Mark your PR as *ready for review*. Normally, you require at least 1 approving review of a verified contributor for it to be able to pass.
7. If the reviewer requests changes, the PR will be on hold until the aforementioned changes are addressed.
8. When everything looks good, your PR will be submitted for quality assurance testing. QA assesments will report back bugs found during testing.. You will be prompted to fix them.
9. Once QA checks have passed, your changes are ready to be merged.

**Warning:** All merged changes must be up to date with the ``main`` branch. 


## Meet the team
> You cannot apply for any of the roles below. Everyone is handpicked based on their skillsets and contributions.
### The Quality Assurance Team
The Quality Assurance Team is responsible for providing useful and meaningful feedback to contributors. For example, every pull request is tested thoroughly before it is implemented in the main project. They play a vital role in preventing any bad or untested code from entering the main codebase.

### Ambassadors
Ambassadors are contributors that actively help the organisation operate and thrive. This is an honorary role given to those that regularly contribute to our projects.


### Developers
Developers are essentially organisation members. They are responsible for managing issues and pull requests and keeping work flowing. Developers are hand-picked Ambassadors that have the appropriate skillsets and maturity to manage and coordinate projects.
